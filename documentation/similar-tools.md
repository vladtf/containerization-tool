## Scope

This document is intended to provide a list of tools taht provide
similar functionality to the Containerization Tool I'm developing.

## Tools

### Packetbeat

- report traffic to ElasticSearch
- can be used to monitor network traffic of a container

### tcpdump

- load balancer
- routing

### Docker Network Configuration

- docker network inspect
- can be used to inspect the network traffic of a container
- can be use to configure forwarding of ports
- docker native solution


### Cisco Packet Tracer

- network simulation
- similar web interface
- doesn't support containers


### starter

- https://github.com/cloud66-oss/starter
- generate Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml
- working only with known frameworks


### heroku buildpacks

- similar to starter
