## Description

Because most of the issue of containerization of an application comes from networking mapping, 
this tool is designed to help developers to install the application in a container and run it.

By monitoring the network traffic of the application, the tool will create reports of the incoming and outgoing traffic of the application.
The developer can see the report in an web interface and decide how to map the network traffic of the application.
